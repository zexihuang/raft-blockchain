1) Leader's previous log is to be overwritten after steps downs.
 a) BUG: after leader partitioned, the client would still send quests to the old leader.
    Then, we the old leader joins back, the client would not resend the transaction request to the new leader (or be relayed to the new leader).
 b) BUG: also in the same case, after the old leader joins as the client, the old client send another transaction request, which would not relay to the new leader for PoW.
 c) Note: the old leader's uncommited entries are overwritten correctly.
2) Transfer transaction test.
 a) BUG: after sending three consecutive transfer requests immediately (transfer $2 to another),
    each transfer transactions are executed successfully, however the balance return for all cases are -2.
 b) BUG: after that, any follow-up transfer transactions won't lead to PoW in the leader, and no return for the client.
 c) Note: further after that, balance transactions can still lead to PoW in the leader, and balance returned is -2.
3) Persistent states.
